1. Dennis Richie created the C language while working at Bell Labs in ~1972.

2. Every C program must contain a main() function which is executed when the program is run.

3. int and static are the 2 C keywords out of these.

4.
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    float x;
    int z;
    x = 10.5;
    z = 21000;
    printf("x = %f z = %d" x, z);
}
