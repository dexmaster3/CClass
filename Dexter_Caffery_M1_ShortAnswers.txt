1. Dennis Richie created the C language while working at Bell Labs in ~1972.

2. Every C program must contain a main() function which is executed when the program is run.

3. int and static are the 2 C keywords out of these.

4.
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    float x;
    int z;
    x = 10.5;
    z = 21000;
    printf("x = %f z = %d", x, z);

    return 0;
}

5. signed long long int  would work as a variable for that range.

6. High level programming languages are a more human readable and understandable form for actions a computer is supposed to perform. Machine code is the low level instructions that a particular processor actually carries out, that our high level code has been compiled to. A processor doesn't actually understand the source code, it needs the compiler to translate.

7. 
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    printf("To be continued\f");
    
    return 0;
}

8. printf() and scanf() are included with <stdio.h> which is a library of functions that must be linked at time of compilation in order to use. #include <stdio.h> must be written at the top of the source code, this is a preprocessor instruction for the compiler/linker.

9. Every C program should have the extention .c   filename.c

10. My compiler requires the following bytes of storage for each type of data:
    int = 4 bytes
    short = 2 bytes
    long = 8 bytes
    float = 4 bytes
    double = 8 bytes
